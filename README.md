# COVID Databot
A simple WIP bot that scrapes https://worldometers.info/coronavirus for live stats.

## Libraries used (discord.py)

- selenium.py
- BeautifulSoup (bs4)
- Panda

## UPDATE!

I have switched over to retrieving data from https://corona-api.com/. Will be looking to work with other APIs
